# [961B_Lecture_Sleep] (https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/961/B)

## Problem Idea

You'll calculate the amount of theorems learnt without using the special trick. 

and then you'll iterate over the prefix sum of the theorems explained while Mishka was asleep, and calculate a fixed window difference with window size k, and take the maximum difference and add it to the number of theorems learnt without the trick. 

## Things to Watch Out For

[List any important details, edge cases, common mistakes, or implementation nuances that you needed to be careful about while solving the problem. This could include:]

* [Specific constraints (e.g., large input sizes, time limits).]
* [Edge cases (e.g., empty input, single element, all elements the same).]
* [Potential for overflow.]
* [Off-by-one errors.]
* [Specific data structure properties or limitations.]
* [Tricky implementation details.]
* [Assumptions you made.]

## Example (Optional)

[You can include a brief example (input and expected output) if it helps illustrate a key aspect of the problem or a tricky edge case.]
