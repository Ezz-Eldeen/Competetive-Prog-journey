## Problem Idea

[A concise explanation of the main idea or algorithm used to solve the problem. Focus on the "what" and "why" of your approach. Keep it brief and easy to understand later.]

## Things to Watch Out For

[List any important details, edge cases, common mistakes, or implementation nuances that you needed to be careful about while solving the problem. This could include:]

* [Specific constraints (e.g., large input sizes, time limits).]
* [Edge cases (e.g., empty input, single element, all elements the same).]
* [Potential for overflow.]
* [Off-by-one errors.]
* [Specific data structure properties or limitations.]
* [Tricky implementation details.]
* [Assumptions you made.]

## Example (Optional)

[You can include a brief example (input and expected output) if it helps illustrate a key aspect of the problem or a tricky edge case.]
